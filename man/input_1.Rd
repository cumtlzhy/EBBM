input_1 :
   Three biclusters are implanted in the data, the sizes of which are 80×13,8×8 and 80×12, respectively.
   The number of reads for each site under each condition in the IP matrix is generated following (2) in the paper EBBM.
   The parameters p of the binomial distribution, which the three biclusters and background follow, are set to 0.65, 0.94, 0.75, and 0.5 respectively,
   to make the whole distribution statistic of the simulated data similar to the real data.The three biclusters did not overlap in sites.
   In conditions, there are 5 overlaps between the first two biclusters, and 3 overlaps between the last two biclusters}

input_2 :
   Three biclusters are implanted in the data, the sizes of which are 80×13,10×8 and 80×12, respectively.
   The number of reads for each site under each condition in the IP matrix is generated following (2) in the paper BBM.
   The parameters p of the binomial distribution, which the three biclusters and background follow, are set to 0.3, 0.98, 0.66, and 0.5 respectively,
   to make the whole distribution statistic of the simulated data similar to the real data.The three biclusters did not overlap in sites.
   In conditions, there are 5 overlaps between the first two biclusters, and 2 overlaps between the last two biclusters
